# Weight Condition Prediction

This project employs machine learning algorithms to classify individuals into weight condition categories (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) based on features like height, weight, and potentially other health indicators.

## 📁 Repository Contents

* `WeightConditionPrediction.ipynb` – A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook detailing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Jupyter Notebook
* Required Python libraries:

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * scikit-learn
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn([GitHub][1])

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jainiltailor/Weight-Condition-Prediction.git
   ```



2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Weight-Condition-Prediction
   ```



3. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



## 📊 Dataset

The dataset utilized should contain relevant features such as height, weight, age, gender, etc., along with the corresponding weight condition labels. Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory and properly referenced within the notebook.

## 🧠 Model Training

The notebook demonstrates the process of training a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree) to classify individuals into different weight condition categories based on the input features.

## 📈 Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and other visualization tools are utilized to assess the model's effectiveness.

## 📌 Usage

To use the trained model for predictions:

1. Open the `WeightConditionPrediction.ipynb` notebook.

2. Follow the instructions to input new data points.

3. Run the prediction cells to obtain the weight condition category.
